# Four_Shades_of_Living_City_Coastal_Village_&_Wilderness

This project is an **interactive 2D/3D simulation** built with **C++ and OpenGL (GLUT)**.  
It brings a lively city environment to life with **dynamic day/night cycles, moving vehicles, trains, planes, boats, rain effects, and multiple user views**.  
The simulation is fully interactive, allowing users to switch perspectives, control the environment, adjust speeds, and toggle effects in real-time.  
Perfect for learning **computer graphics, animation, and OpenGL programming**.

## Features
- **Multiple Views**: Switch perspectives (Azim, Fuad, Ishraq, Mahfuz).
- **Dynamic Environments**: Day, Night, and Rain scenes.
- **Moving Objects**: Cars, bus, train, plane, clouds, and boats.
- **Interactive Controls**: Speed adjustment, rain intensity, sound toggle.
